This is my E-commerce website with many different feature such as

- Navigation and routing that takes the user to different pages of categories of items.

- From these items, users can add them to their cart.

- From the the cart you can see the items update, increase/ decrease, and remove from both the cart and checkout page.

- Complete live changes on both the cart and checkout page.

- This is integrated with firebase for both sign in altercation using google, sign in/ out, and sign up feature. It also uses firebase as a database.

- This is also integrated with the Stripe api for payments.
